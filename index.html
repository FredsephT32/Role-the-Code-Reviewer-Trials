          <h3>Life</h3>
          <hr>
      <p>Nakamura was born on 15 September 1946, Japan  in Fukuoka, a city in Fukuoka Prefecture on the northern shore of the Japanese island Kyushu. He graduated from Kyushu University School Early life and education
        of Medicine in 1973, after studying at Koga Nishi Elementary School, Seinan Gakuin Junior High School, and Fukuoka Prefectural Fukuoka High School. 
        <br><br>
        Nakamura ﬁrst arrived in the region in 1984 as a volunteer with the Japan Overseas Christian Medical Cooperative Service at the Mission Hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan to treat patients with leprosy as well as Afghan refugees who were ﬂeeing the Soviet–Afghan War.He initially intended to stay in Peshawar for ﬁve to six years.
        <br><br>
        Beginning in 1991,Nakamura opened three clinics to provide medical service in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, where he identiﬁed malnutrition as a root cause for the health issues in the region
        <br><br>
        Starting from 2000, a drought hit the region. A consequence of this drought was the multiplications of diseases due to malnutrition and lack of water. Nakamura stated about this situation: "One irrigation canal will do more good than 100
        doctors. He also said: "A hospital treats patients one by one, but this helps an entire village.
        <br><br>
        Starting from 2003, Nakamura started building an irrigation canal in the Khewa District (Kuz Kunar) of Nangarhar Province, the Marwarid Canal.
        <br><br>In Afghanistan, Nakamura risked his life several times. He once narrowly escaped machine-gun ﬁre from a U.S. military helicopter.
         On another occasion, he rushed to protect levees from a dangerously overﬂowing river.
